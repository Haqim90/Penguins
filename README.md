# Penguins
The objective of this project is to build a classifier model to classify species based on penguin physical measurements whether a penguin is classified as an Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo. This dataset is a multiclass classification (3 classes) with supervised learning. In this project we will be using Decision Tree Classifier as our prediction model.

The data was collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antartica LTER. Their goal was to provide a great dataset for data exploration, visualisation and — in this case — a demonstration of the Scikit-Learn API.

The data set contains measurements for different species of penguins living at the Palmer station:

The tools we will be using are:

Pandas, used for data analysis and manipulation
Numpy, used for scientific computation
Matplotlib, used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualization
Seaborn, used for data visualization matplotlib based
Sklearn, used for predictive data analysis
